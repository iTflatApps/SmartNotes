## Issue and Pull Requests

- If you're not sure about adding something, [open an issue](https://github.com/iTflatApps/SmartNotes/issues/new/choose) to discuss it.
- Feel free to open a Pull Request early so that a discussion can be had as changes are developed.
- Include screenshots and animated gifs of your changes whenever possible.
- **DON'T** surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount of time. surprise us with big pull requests.

## Commit messages

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification to standardize our commit history. <br> The commit message summary (or pull request title) is constructed by prepending the type of change being made (e.g., *feat*, *fix*, *refactor*), followed by an imperative, present tense sentence (without a period). Example: `fix: make header bold`

> Types other than *fix:* and *feat:* are allowed.
